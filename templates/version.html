    This is a program of a DBMS “Data Base Management System” For a clinic using python and the flask framework to make<br>
    the python app work as a webapp. The program has two main modules: (patient, user). The patient module has the data<br>
    of all the doctors saved in the clinic and their information. The user module has a login page that every user logs<br>
    in with the username and password. The program checks automatically if the username and password are saved in the<br>
    database it makes the user go in, and if the user is a doctor, it shows him the doctor module, and if he is an<br>
    admin, it shows him the admin module.<br><br>
    The doctor module can add new patients and add details for the doctor and change the password, add new patient, and<br>
    manage the prices of the doctor himself. There is a page named show all that shows all the patients saved by the<br>
    doctor logged in and have an add record button that saves every time the patient goes to this doctor it saves the<br>
    data for this time with the date and the price. There is an open patient page that shows all the information of that<br>
    patient and there is an open and add prescription that have saves the prescription and has a button to print them if<br>
    there is a printer connected. And if the user clicks on the date on the table, it opens another page that have all<br>
    the details of that record to the patient with that date. On the show all page there is a filter by gender, by date<br>
    and by id that filters by everything as the names of them shows. On the show doctor details there is an upload photo<br>
    option for the doctor to add his photo and it will be shown on the patient module.<br><br>
    The admin module has a home page that shows all transactions that happened by all the doctors and the doctor and<br>
    patient Id that if you click on them, it shows this doctor details and the same thing for the patient’s id and there<br>
    is a filter by date. The transactions table also has the date that this transaction happened on. Thei is also<br>
    another pages that are the show all doctors, patients that shows all of them and there is a search patient by id and<br>
    doctor by his id on the navigation bar and the admin could delete the patients and the doctors, And if the admin<br>
    opens the doctor details it shows to him his details but can’t edit them except the prices because that the doctor<br>
    can’t edit them and there are shown in the bottom of the page on a table. Lately the admin is the only one that can<br>
    add a new user on a register page he adds the name and the details of the user and choose from the bottom if this is<br>
    an admin like him or a doctor.
